## üì• Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

**Required Tools:**
- `apktool` - APK decompilation/compilation
- `metasploit-framework` - Payload generation
- `default-jdk` - Java development kit
- `zipalign` - APK optimization (optional but recommended)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n31nym0u2/thelazycat.git
   cd thelazycat
   ```
2. **Set Execution Permissions**
   ```bash
   chmod +x thelazycat
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies (Kali Linux/Ubuntu)**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install apktool metasploit-framework default-jdk zipalign -y
   ```
4. **Verification**
   ```bash
   sudo ./thelazycat
   ```

## üîß APKTool Install Manually ( Kali Linux/Ubuntu)
  ```bash
  # Install Dependencies
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install default-jre curl wget

  # Download the wrapper script
  sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/apktool https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/master/scripts/linux/apktool

  # Download the latest APKTool jar file
  sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/apktool.jar https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/apktool_2.9.3.jar

  # Make both executable
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/apktool
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/apktool.jar

  ```

### Payload Integration

The tool leverages $\text{Smali}$ code integration and $\text{Manifest}$ modification to seamlessly embed the payload:

  * **Payload Type:** Meterpreter reverse TCP payload.
  * **Injection Method:** $\text{Smali}$ code integration into the target application's execution flow (typically the main activity).
  * **Modifications:** Automated $\text{Manifest}$ modification for required permissions and component registration (services, receivers).
  * **Resource Management:** Automated resource merging and conflict resolution.

### Persistence Mechanisms

To ensure reliable, long-term access:

  * **Service Persistence:** Injects a background service that automatically attempts to restart if terminated.
  * **Boot Receiver:** Registers a receiver component to auto-start the payload on the device's reboot.
  * **Activity Injection:** Executes the primary payload within the main application activity's lifecycle.
  * **Foreground Service (Optional):** Can be configured to maintain background execution with higher system priority.

### Permission Sets

The tool offers flexibility in defining the payload's capabilities:

| Permission Set | Description | Key Permissions Included |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Default** | Basic permissions required for network connection and persistence. | `android.permission.INTERNET`, `android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` |
| **Custom** | Allows the user to select additional, specific permissions as needed. | User-selected (e.g., `READ_CONTACTS`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`) |
| **Full Control** | Comprehensive set for maximum access, intended for deeply authorized testing. | Includes all common invasive permissions. |

## üì± Application Structure Compatibility

$\text{APKPwn}$ is most effective against standard applications but has limitations against modern protection techniques.

### ‚úÖ WORKING Application Types

These types generally have standard Android build structures that the injector can successfully modify:

  * **Standard Android Applications:** Single/Multiple Activity Apps, traditional **Java**-based, **Kotlin** applications (converted to $\text{Smali}$), Simple utility apps.
  * **Game Applications:** **Unity**-based, **Cocos2d-x**, **Cocos2d-JS**, and simple 2D game engines.
  * **Utility & Productivity Apps:** File managers, System tools, Media players, Camera/Gallery, Note-taking apps.
  * **Educational & Social Apps:** E-book readers, Simple messaging/Social media clients, Weather/Reference applications.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING Application Types

Success is dependent on the specific build configuration and often requires manual post-modification steps:

  * **Hybrid & Complex Applications:** $\text{Cordova/PhoneGap}$ (often requires manual configuration), $\text{React Native}$ (success varies), Multi-module and enterprise applications, Apps with basic JNI/native components.

### ‚ùå NOT WORKING Application Types

These applications employ techniques that actively prevent or severely complicate $\text{Smali}$-level modification:

  * **Protected & Obfuscated Apps:** Heavily **ProGuard** optimized, **DexGuard** protected, Apps with string encryption, control flow obfuscation, anti-tampering, or root detection.
  * **Advanced Framework Apps:** **Flutter** applications (Dart-compiled, not $\text{Smali}$), $\text{Xamarin}$ apps (.NET compiled), Native-only activities and applications, Unity **IL2CPP** builds.
  * **Security & System Apps:** $\text{VPN}$ and security-focused applications, Banking/financial apps with advanced protection, Pre-installed system applications, Device administrator/policy controllers.

| Application Type | Success Rate | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Simple Utility Apps | 95% | High compatibility. |
| Unity Games | 85% | Good success rate. |
| Social Media Apps | 75% | Medium success, common anti-tampering is manageable. |
| Banking Apps | 40% | Low due to advanced protection mechanisms. |
| System Apps | 20% | Very low success due to high privileges and system integrity checks. |
| Obfuscated Apps | 15% | Rarely works unless obfuscation is basic. |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Potential Solution(s) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Build Errors** | Ensure sufficient disk space; Check for resource conflicts; Verify all script dependencies are correctly installed. |
| **Signing Issues** | Verify **Java** installation and environment variables; Check keystore file permissions; Ensure adequate certificate validity period. |
| **Persistence Not Working** | Test on different Android OS versions; Check the target device's battery optimization settings; Verify that the required permissions were explicitly granted by the user post-installation. |

### Debug Mode

For detailed logging and to diagnose complex issues, modify the script to allow for verbose output:

```bash
# Remove "> /dev/null 2>&1" from commands for verbose output
```
